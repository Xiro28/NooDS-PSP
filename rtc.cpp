// I find GBATEK's RTC documentation to be lacking, so here's a quick summary of how the I/O works
//
// Bits 2 and 6 are connected to the CS pinout
// Bit 6 should always be set, so setting bit 2 to 1 or 0 causes CS to be high or low, respectively
//
// Bits 1 and 5 are connected to the SCK pinout
// Bit 5 should always be set, so setting bit 1 to 1 or 0 causes SCK to be high or low, respectively
//
// Bits 0 and 4 are connected to the SIO pinout
// Bit 4 indicates data direction; 0 is read, and 1 is write
// Bit 0 is where data sent from the RTC is read, and where data sent to the RTC is written
//
// To start a transfer, switch CS from low to high
// To end a transfer, switch CS from high to low
//
// To transfer a bit, set SCK to low and then high (it should be high when the transfer starts)
// When writing a bit to the RTC, you should set bit 0 at the same time as setting SCK to low
// When reading a bit from the RTC, you should read bit 0 after setting SCK to low (or high?)
